              We cannot charge you if your order was not completed successfully.
              Our secure system requires manual capture to process payments. In
              some cases, failed payment attempts can occur due to bank
              processes or location differences.

            <p>
              When you notice an amount charged on your bank account, it may be
              because certain banks display charges immediately, even for
              unsuccessful payment attempts. These charges typically
              <strong
                >appear as pending charges and are reversed within 3-5 working
                days</strong
              >, depending on the bank.
            </p>
            <p>
              In some cases, customers may experience similar difficulties,
              often related to order billing address mismatches with the credit
              card billing address. Nevertheless, these customers have always
              managed to place orders in the end :-)

              Unfortunately we do not offer the cotton drawstring for sale
              separately. These drawstrings are specially crafted to complement
              the bags showcased on our website, and they are not available as
              standalone items.
            </p>
            <p>
              Introducing the drawstrings as individual products would
              necessitate additional manpower, which we currently do not have,
              and we are committed to avoiding overburdening our skilled
              weavers.

              If you purchased the bag <strong>from our website</strong>,
              <strong>please send us an email</strong> at
              <a href="mailto:orders@dragondiffusion.net "

              If you bought the bag <strong>from one of our retailers</strong>,
              it's best to <strong>contact the retailer directly</strong>. They
              will get in touch with us if needed.

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              Since we use <strong>natural dyes</strong>, they can sometimes
              bleed initially, especially in dark colors or if the bag is
              <strong>exposed to high humidity</strong>. This does not happen
              often, but it can occur.
            </p>
            <p>
              The more natural approach is to leave your bag in the sunlight for
              several hours. The sun's rays will help set the dye pigments.
            </p>
            <p>
              As the dyes are natural, it may take some time for them to stop
              bleeding. Over time and some use, the bags will develop a special
              used patina that in fact enhances the feel and look of your Dragon
              Bag.
