This facemask has been built using an highly elasticated construction that retains its shape over time, meaning that it doesn’t feel tight and contours to the shape of your face and it won’t stretch out. On top of that, the material is breathable, helping prevent sweat and moisture build-up and keep you warm, dry, and breathing easy for longer, even in the toughest conditions.",

Then, we went one step further and gave them a neoprene cuff for warmth and durability, a cosy fleece lining and a super strong polyurethane palm for both abrasion and water resistance. And for breathability, we skipped the plastic membrane to make sure your hands never get sweaty again! All in all, these gloves are perfect for long days on the mountain. And they’re made even better with a non-slip palm print, ideal for slippery button lifts. We think that all sounds pretty great. Don’t you?",

With a TPU palm and a 15k/15k water resistant and breathable back, the areas exposed to the elements the most are given the most protection. For added breathability and to eliminate sweat buildup, a lightweight nylon riptstop has been added between the fingers, along with a low-profile, slim-fitting cuff for superior jacket-to-glove fit. Inside, a microfleece liner balances warmth with breathability, ensuring stable and reliable heat management no matter the conditions. Built to endure cold winters, slushy springs, and everything in between, the Ace is the cornerstone of our glove lineup and the perfect glove for all adventures.",

      "description": "The Ace gloves are built for winter and ready for anything. We made them with Dope Performance 15K fabric, which has an awesome 15k/15k waterproofing and breathability rating! Then, we went one step further and gave them a neoprene cuff for warmth and durability, a cosy fleece lining and a super strong polyurethane palm for both abrasion and water resistance. And for breathability, we skipped the plastic membrane to make sure your hands never get sweaty again! All in all, these gloves are perfect for long days on the mountain. And they’re made even better with a non-slip palm print, ideal for slippery button lifts. We think that all sounds pretty great. Don’t you?",

      "description": "Allow us to introduce the Dope B.I.G. Pants, a fresh addition to our All Mountain lineup. These pants are designed for maximum mobility with a clean, effortless style, and the fewest seams possible for enhanced durability and weatherproofing. We also threw in a dropped crotch and a baggy, wide-leg fit for ultimate comfort and a laid-back look. And with two zipped side pockets, a built-in stretchy belt with an aluminium buckle, and a zipped fly, these pants are perfect for all-mountain adventures, offering park-rat fashion with big mountain capability. Utilising our highest performance materials and design, this collection provides maximum environmental protection, and features designed to ride the biggest lines and the deepest powder. This collection can do it all, no matter the conditions. bluesign®: bluesign® is a rigorous certification that ensures our clothing is sustainably produced, reducing water waste and harmful chemicals. This means safer working conditions for workers and a cleaner environment for all. This is a bluesign® approved product, adhering to the highest standard in the bluesign® certification. Recycled: Our Recycled Polyester PET is sourced from repurposed plastic bottles. It significantly reduces pollution, lowers greenhouse gas emissions, and conserves energy and water compared to virgin polyester. Recycled materials on this product: All Shell Fabric, All Insulation and All Lining Elasticated Belt and Waistband: Get the perfect fit with a super comfortable and fully removable elasticated belt. Elasticated Snow Gaiters: Non-slip cuff with lace hook for secure snow protection. Adjustable Drawstring Hem: Customise your fit with an integrated drawstring and toggle adjuster. Fly Closure: Zipped fly opening for comfort and easy wardrobe changes. Waterproofing: Snow and rain are part of a rider's reality. That's why we use a bonded waterproof membrane that provides a solid barrier against moisture, together with a PFAS-free DWR treatment for rapid water beading and runoff. 15.000 mm – DRY Tech. Breathability: Managing the humidity that builds up inside from body heat is crucial. Our bonded membrane system offers top-notch breathability, effectively managing moisture. 15.000 g – DRY Tech. Taped Seams: The seams are the weakest point of any garment, so by applying a special adhesive tape that makes sure water can't get in, you can ride in the worst conditions with confidence.

      "description": "Sleek, stylish, and ready for anything, the Blizzard Full Zip is a rider-favourite that blends comfort and performance, without the bulk. This zip-through combines a bombproof 2-way stretch outer shell with the sort of technical specs you’d see on a big-ticket coat, and a minimalist ethos that ditches unnecessary features to keep you light on your feet this season. The Blizzard is a simplified all-mountain brawler that’ll stand up to pretty much anything mother nature serves up, and will no doubt be the jacket you reach for again and again this season thanks to its simple, comfy, capable, and rider-forward design. Built around a lightweight and bombproof shell fabric platform with built in 2-way stretch, the Freedom collection is designed for maximum mobility. A minimalist approach keeps you light on your feet so you can truly push your riding. bluesign®: bluesign® is a rigorous certification that ensures our clothing is sustainably produced, reducing water waste and harmful chemicals. This means safer working conditions for workers and a cleaner environment for all. This is a bluesign® approved product, adhering to the highest standard in the bluesign® certification. Recycled: Our Recycled Polyester PET is sourced from repurposed plastic bottles. It significantly reduces pollution, lowers greenhouse gas emissions, and conserves energy and water compared to virgin polyester. Recycled materials on this product: All Shell Fabric, All Insulation and All Lining Storm Guard Hood: Helmet-compatible storm guard hood with front and rear drawstring adjustment for the perfect fit. Underarm Vents: Large zipped vents are perfect for quick cooling. Media Pocket: Easy-access pocket made specifically for phones with internal headphone cord outlet Lift Pass Pocket: A velcro pocket for your ski pass perfectly located on the left sleeve for easy access. Wrist Gaiters: Stretchy and comfortable, perfect for keeping the snow out. Front Zipper with Double Plackets: Double placket system ensures waterproofing in tough conditions. Microfleece Chinguard: Super soft microfleece lined chinguard Drawstring Hem: Adjustable drawstring hem lets you customise your fit and style. Waterproofing: Snow and rain are part of a rider's reality. That's why we use a bonded waterproof membrane that provides a solid barrier against moisture, together with a PFAS-free DWR treatment for rapid water beading and runoff. 15.000 mm – DRY Tech. Breathability: Managing the humidity that builds up inside from body heat is crucial. Our bonded membrane system offers top-notch breathability, effectively managing moisture. 15.000 g – DRY Tech. Taped Seams: The seams are the weakest point of any garment, so by applying a special adhesive tape that makes sure water can't get in, you can ride in the worst conditions with confidence. Fully taped – TSGS. Climate Control: Thermal Insulation with state-of-the-art materials, combining perfect comfort with high thermal insulation properties, for true all-day comfort. 60/40 gsm – Fellex®.",

      "description": "Sleek, stylish, and ready for anything, the Blizzard Full Zip is a rider-favourite that blends comfort and performance, without the bulk. This zip-through combines a bombproof 2-way stretch outer shell with the sort of technical specs you’d see on a big-ticket coat, and a minimalist ethos that ditches unnecessary features to keep you light on your feet this season. The Blizzard is a simplified all-mountain brawler that’ll stand up to pretty much anything mother nature serves up, and will no doubt be the jacket you reach for again and again this season thanks to its simple, comfy, capable, and rider-forward design. Built around a lightweight and bombproof shell fabric platform with built in 2-way stretch, the Freedom collection is designed for maximum mobility. A minimalist approach keeps you light on your feet so you can truly push your riding. bluesign®: bluesign® is a rigorous certification that ensures our clothing is sustainably produced, reducing water waste and harmful chemicals. This means safer working conditions for workers and a cleaner environment for all. This is a bluesign® approved product, adhering to the highest standard in the bluesign® certification. Recycled: Our Recycled Polyester PET is sourced from repurposed plastic bottles. It significantly reduces pollution, lowers greenhouse gas emissions, and conserves energy and water compared to virgin polyester. Recycled materials on this product: All Shell Fabric, All Insulation and All Lining Storm Guard Hood: Helmet-compatible storm guard hood with front and rear drawstring adjustment for the perfect fit. Underarm Vents: Large zipped vents are perfect for quick cooling. Media Pocket: Easy-access pocket made specifically for phones with internal headphone cord outlet Lift Pass Pocket: A velcro pocket for your ski pass perfectly located on the left sleeve for easy access. Wrist Gaiters: Stretchy and comfortable, perfect for keeping the snow out. Front Zipper with Double Plackets: Double placket system ensures waterproofing in tough conditions. Microfleece Chinguard: Super soft microfleece lined chinguard Drawstring Hem: Adjustable drawstring hem lets you customise your fit and style. Waterproofing: Snow and rain are part of a rider's reality. That's why we use a bonded waterproof membrane that provides a solid barrier against moisture, together with a PFAS-free DWR treatment for rapid water beading and runoff. 15.000 mm – DRY Tech. Breathability: Managing the humidity that builds up inside from body heat is crucial. Our bonded membrane system offers top-notch breathability, effectively managing moisture. 15.000 g – DRY Tech. Taped Seams: The seams are the weakest point of any garment, so by applying a special adhesive tape that makes sure water can't get in, you can ride in the worst conditions with confidence. Fully taped – TSGS. Climate Control: Thermal Insulation with state-of-the-art materials, combining perfect comfort with high thermal insulation properties, for true all-day comfort. 60/40 gsm – Fellex®.",

These pants are special because they not only have that slimmer, thigh-hugging fit you’ve been craving, but are also super comfortable and provide total freedom of movement thanks to our improved 2-way stretch shell material. So, you still get that slim-cut profile, but with no awkward pulling or tugging, which makes the Con the ultimate pair of figure-hugging riding pants perfect for the whole mountain. Utilising our highest performance materials and design, this collection provides maximum environmental protection, and features designed to ride the biggest lines and the deepest powder. This collection can do it all, no matter the conditions. bluesign®: bluesign® is a rigorous certification that ensures our clothing is sustainably produced, reducing water waste and harmful chemicals. This means safer working conditions for workers and a cleaner environment for all. This is a bluesign® approved product, adhering to the highest standard in the bluesign® certification. Recycled: Our Recycled Polyester PET is sourced from repurposed plastic bottles. It significantly reduces pollution, lowers greenhouse gas emissions, and conserves energy and water compared to virgin polyester. Recycled materials on this product: All Shell Fabric and All Insulation. Zipped and Meshed Vents: Meshed and zippered vents make cooling off super simple. Elasticated Snow Gaiters: Non-slip cuff with lace hook for secure snow protection. Zippered Gusseted Hems: Gusseted hems provide enhanced boot fit, tailored snow protection, and a customisable look. Elastic Adjustable Waistband: Elasticated velcro tabs for quick and secure adjustment. For the perfect fit! Belt Loops for Suspenders: Velcro belt loops are compatible with Dope suspenders. Reinforced Fly Closure: Dual snap button and velcro closure for secure and comfortable fit. Waterproofing: Snow and rain are part of a rider's reality. That's why we use a bonded waterproof membrane that provides a solid barrier against moisture, together with a PFAS-free DWR treatment for rapid water beading and runoff. 15.000 mm – DRY Tech. Breathability: Managing the humidity that builds up inside from body heat is crucial. Our bonded membrane system offers top-notch breathability, effectively managing moisture. 15.000 g – DRY Tech. Taped Seams: The seams are the weakest point of any garment, so by applying a special adhesive tape that makes sure water can't get in, you can ride in the worst conditions with confidence. Fully taped – Sealon. Climate Control: Thermal Insulation with state-of-the-art materials, combining perfect comfort with high thermal insulation properties, for true all-day comfort. 40 gsm – Fellex®.",

      "description": "The Con pants perfectly blend form and function, and are a team and rider favourite for good reason. These pants are special because they not only have that slimmer, thigh-hugging fit you’ve been craving, but are also super comfortable and provide total freedom of movement thanks to our improved 2-way stretch shell material. So, you still get that slim-cut profile, but with no awkward pulling or tugging, which makes the Con the ultimate pair of figure-hugging riding pants perfect for the whole mountain. Utilising our highest performance materials and design, this collection provides maximum environmental protection, and features designed to ride the biggest lines and the deepest powder. This collection can do it all, no matter the conditions. bluesign®: bluesign® is a rigorous certification that ensures our clothing is sustainably produced, reducing water waste and harmful chemicals. This means safer working conditions for workers and a cleaner environment for all. This is a bluesign® approved product, adhering to the highest standard in the bluesign® certification. Recycled: Our Recycled Polyester PET is sourced from repurposed plastic bottles. It significantly reduces pollution, lowers greenhouse gas emissions, and conserves energy and water compared to virgin polyester. Recycled materials on this product: All Shell Fabric and All Insulation. Zipped and Meshed Vents: Meshed and zippered vents make cooling off super simple. Elasticated Snow Gaiters: Non-slip cuff with lace hook for secure snow protection. Zippered Gusseted Hems: Gusseted hems provide enhanced boot fit, tailored snow protection, and a customisable look.

Reinforced Fly Closure: Dual snap button and velcro closure for secure and comfortable fit. Waterproofing: Snow and rain are part of a rider's reality. That's why we use a bonded waterproof membrane that provides a solid barrier against moisture, together with a PFAS-free DWR treatment for rapid water beading and runoff. 15.000 mm – DRY Tech. Breathability: Managing the humidity that builds up inside from body heat is crucial. Our bonded membrane system offers top-notch breathability, effectively managing moisture. 15.000 g – DRY Tech.

      "description": "The Cozy Hood from Dope is a revolution in neck warmers. Made from our super soft 250gsm 100% recycled polyester fleece, this thing will keep you toasty all day long! It's a hood combined with a neck-tube that you can pull down when you need some air, and with a drawstring adjustable hood to get that fit just right, this neck warmer is a lot more versatile than it first appears. But what about my helmet, you ask? Well, you’ll be glad to know that we built these neck warmers to accommodate a helmet, too. So you can really style it up and throw your helmet on under it. Wear it pulled down around your neck when you’re cruising, and pull it up for the deep stuff, the Cozy Hood is an all-mountain neck warmer that looks good, and feels even better. bluesign®: bluesign® is a rigorous certification that ensures our clothing is sustainably produced, reducing water waste and harmful chemicals. This means safer working conditions for workers and a cleaner environment for all. This is a bluesign® approved product, adhering to the highest standard in the bluesign® certification.

Made with our awesome 100% recycled polyester fleece, it has a relaxed fit and a super-soft handfeel. With a brushed inner and outer, this hoodie is toasty warm and comfy as heck! And with a 250gsm fabric weight, it’s ideal for even the coldest evenings kicking around the resort. We threw in a gusseted collar and bottom drawstring to keep the windchill out, and zipped pockets on the belly pouch to keep your stuff safe as you slip and slide back home. We’ve just about covered all the bases here, and the result is a hoodie that’s gosh dang plush, and well-equipped to deal with the slush. bluesign®: bluesign® is a rigorous certification that ensures our clothing is sustainably produced, reducing water waste and harmful chemicals.

The Iconic are superbly waterproof, tailored to perfection with a relaxed and dropped-crotch fit, and so damn handsome that you can't quite look directly at them — kind of like the sun. And now, you too can share in their sheer, blinding magnificence, too, by owning your own pair. Utilising our highest performance materials and design, this collection provides maximum environmental protection, and features designed to ride the biggest lines and the deepest powder. This collection can do it all, no matter the conditions. bluesign®: bluesign® is a rigorous certification that ensures our clothing is sustainably produced, reducing water waste and harmful chemicals.

This durable and colorfast textile marks a significant shift towards environmentally responsible practices. Solution Dyed materials on this product: All Lining Fabric. Zipped and Meshed Vents: Meshed and zippered vents make cooling off super simple. Elasticated Snow Gaiters: Non-slip cuff with lace hook for secure snow protection. Zippered Gusseted Hems: Gusseted hems provide enhanced boot fit, tailored snow protection, and a customisable look. Elastic Adjustable Waistband: Elasticated velcro tabs for quick and secure adjustment. For the perfect fit! Belt Loops for Suspenders: Velcro belt loops are compatible with Dope suspenders. Reinforced Fly Closure: Dual snap button and velcro closure for secure and comfortable fit. Waterproofing: Snow and rain are part of a rider's reality. That's why we use a bonded waterproof membrane that provides a solid barrier against moisture, together with a PFAS-free DWR treatment for rapid water beading and runoff. 15.000 mm – DRY Tech. Breathability: Managing the humidity that builds up inside from body heat is crucial. Our bonded membrane system offers top-notch breathability, effectively managing moisture. 15.000 g – DRY Tech. Taped Seams: The seams are the weakest point of any garment, so by applying a special adhesive tape that makes sure water can't get in, you can ride in the worst conditions with confidence.

Inspired by our Legacy jacket, the Zenith embodies a less-is-more ethos, delivering all the essential features you need for a long day on the mountain, without unnecessary bulk. Built to tear up the hill all season long thanks to its supreme versatility, but carefully crafted with a lightweight design that puts riding freedom at the forefront, the Zenith is sure to be the jacket you reach for again and again this winter. On the JT Zenith, we removed the chest pockets and added magnetic closure on all pockets and the front placket. On top of that, we switched out all the lining to an ultra-light, super-stretchy fabric for added lightness and movability.

We gave them a few cool upgrades this year, making them from the same awesome polyester and spandex mix you’ve come to know and love. Up top they’ve got that stylish high-waisted cut with a laser-cut phone pocket for complete pressure reduction and versatility, while lower down we gave them flatlock seams to eliminate chafing. Then we finished them off with an above-the-ankle cut for total compatibility with all socks and trainers. Are these the perfect gym leggings? You decide.",

We gave them a few cool upgrades this year, making them from the same awesome polyester and spandex mix you’ve come to know and love. Up top they’ve got that stylish high-waisted cut with a laser-cut phone pocket for complete pressure reduction and versatility, while lower down we gave them flatlock seams to eliminate chafing. Then we finished them off with an above-the-ankle cut for total compatibility with all socks and trainers. Are these the perfect gym leggings? You decide.",

We started with the same amazing high-waisted design as our classic Lofty leggings, and made them from the same super stretchy and comfy polyester and spandex blend. Then we gave them a little something extra with a laser-cut pocket for your phone at the back of the waistband, and a unique off-set seam and panel construction with two extra mesh pockets. This allows them to flex more naturally without pulling, giving an even greater range of motion, as well as making them super handy for carrying your cards, a key, or anything else! All this makes the Lofty leggings ideal for extreme sports or for those situations where you really need to push just a little harder, and the most versatile and useful leggings around.",

      "description": "The Hiker LIGHT is a super lightweight and packable hiking jacket designed to keep you agile on the mountain this season. With a quarter opening collar and brimmed two-way adjustable hood, it's an ideal all-weather jacket that will have no problem keeping the rain off your back. An oversized front pocket combined with a full-length side zipper to make versatility a key part of its design, ensuring that this is a jacket you can reach for come rain or shine. Purpose-built for adventure, these jackets and pants are perfect for exploring the city, or setting your sights on distant mountain peaks. Storm Guard Hood: Shaped hood with front and rear adjustment options for ultimate weather protection. Underarm Vents: Large zipped vents are perfect for quick cooling. Media Pocket: Easy-access pocket made specifically for phones with internal headphone cord outlet Side Zipper with Inner Placket: Waterproof side zipper and wide inner placket ensures waterproofing in tough conditions. Lift Pass Pocket: A velcro pocket for your ski pass perfectly located on the left sleeve for easy access. Velcro Adjustable Cuffs: Tighten or loosen your cuffs with secure velcro straps. Drawstring Hem: Adjustable drawstring hem lets you customise your fit and style. Dope DRYTECH Membrane: Dope DRYTECH membrane offers superior waterproofing and breathability through the use of hydrophilic membrane technology.

Durable Water Repellent (DWR): All of our fabrics are treated using a PFAS-free, eco friendly DWR treatment from HeiQ EcoDry. Water beads off instead of soaking in, improving waterproofing, and keep the fabric working at maximum breathability.. Fully Taped Seams: We fully tape our seams to make sure water can't get in. The seams are the weakest point of any garment, so by using a special tape that makes them totally waterproof, you can ride in the deepest powder or the gnarliest storms with confidence.. Shell Fabric LIGHT: Our ultra light 2-layer laminated shell is equipped with a super tough woven outer, and a unique Dope DRYTECH waterproof membrane. Enhanced with an eco-friendly high-performance DWR treatment, this shell fabric is adventure ready, with amazing waterproofing and breathability, and unbeatable durability. bluesign® approved materials..",

      "description": "When it comes to chunky, cosy fleeces, the Pile is the only choice. Made using a super soft 285gsm 100% polyester Hi-loft fleece, it’s the ideal companion for your mountain adventures. And with its ultra-warm design, and stellar breathability, it’s great for winter use around the resort, but also as the perfect mid-layer for those colder days on the hill. With a chimney-style collar and quarter-zip design, you can warm up or cool off when you need to. With its elasticated cuffs, the sleeves won’t ride up under your ski jacket, and thanks to its oversized, double-zipped handwarmer pocket, your valuables are kept safe and secure all day. We finished it off with a drawstring hem, and a healthy dose of our unique Dope styling to make it your new favourite fleece for this winter season. Half-Zip Collar: A chimney collar with half-zip construction to keep warm or cool off. Zipped Hand Warmer Pocket: Oversized hand warmer pocket with dual-zip opening for spacious secure storage. Elasticated Cuffs: Elasticated cuffs lock warmth in and stop your sleeves from riding up. Drawstring Hem: Adjustable drawstring hem lets you customise your fit and style.",

      "description": "When it comes to chunky, cosy fleeces, the Pile is the only choice. Made using a super soft 285gsm 100% polyester Hi-loft fleece, it’s the ideal companion for your mountain adventures. And with its ultra-warm design, and stellar breathability, it’s great for winter use around the resort, but also as the perfect mid-layer for those colder days on the hill. With a chimney-style collar and quarter-zip design, you can warm up or cool off when you need to. With its elasticated cuffs, the sleeves won’t ride up under your ski jacket, and thanks to its oversized, double-zipped handwarmer pocket, your valuables are kept safe and secure all day. We finished it off with a drawstring hem, and a healthy dose of our unique Dope styling to make it your new favourite fleece for this winter season. Half-Zip Collar: A chimney collar with half-zip construction to keep warm or cool off. Zipped Hand Warmer Pocket: Oversized hand warmer pocket with dual-zip opening for spacious secure storage. Elasticated Cuffs: Elasticated cuffs lock warmth in and stop your sleeves from riding up. Drawstring Hem: Adjustable drawstring hem lets you customise your fit and style.",

Made using a super soft 285gsm 100% polyester Hi-loft fleece, it’s the ideal companion for your mountain adventures. And with its ultra-warm design, and stellar breathability, it’s great for winter use around the resort, but also as the perfect mid-layer for those colder days on the hill. With a chimney-style collar and quarter-zip design, you can warm up or cool off when you need to. With its elasticated cuffs, the sleeves won’t ride up under your ski jacket, and thanks to its oversized, double-zipped handwarmer pocket, your valuables are kept safe and secure all day. We finished it off with a drawstring hem, and a healthy dose of our unique Dope styling to make it your new favourite fleece for this winter season.

Purpose-built for adventure, these jackets and pants are perfect for exploring the city, or setting your sights on distant mountain peaks. Brimmed Storm Hood: A shaped hood with front and rear adjusters helps keep the rain off your face and the brim reduces dripping. Underarm Vents: Large zipped vents are perfect for quick cooling. Media Pocket: Easy-access pocket made specifically for phones with internal headphone cord outlet Velcro Adjustable Cuffs: Tighten or loosen your cuffs with secure velcro straps. Drawstring Hem: Adjustable drawstring hem lets you customise your fit and style. Dope DRYTECH Membrane: Dope DRYTECH membrane offers superior waterproofing and breathability through the use of hydrophilic membrane technology.

Durable Water Repellent (DWR): All of our fabrics are treated using a PFAS-free, eco friendly DWR treatment from HeiQ EcoDry. Water beads off instead of soaking in, improving waterproofing, and keep the fabric working at maximum breathability.. Fully Taped Seams: We fully tape our seams to make sure water can't get in. The seams are the weakest point of any garment, so by using a special tape that makes them totally waterproof, you can ride in the deepest powder or the gnarliest storms with confidence.. 3-Layer Stretch Fabric: Our 3-layer 4-way stretch super lightweight shell has a smooth, eco-friendly high-performance DWR treated outer, along with a highly waterproof inner membrane. Laminated together with a smooth tricot backer for ultimate comfort, it offers totally mobility without bulk for unbeatable versatility, no matter the situation. bluesign® approved materials..",

      "description": "The Downpour pants are brand new to the Dope lineup for this season, and are built using our awesome featherlight 3-layer shell fabric with built-in 4-way stretch. These packable pants are perfect to throw in your rucksack for your next hike, and slip right over your normal walking pants to provide a durable and comfy weather shield made to perform in tough conditions. Purpose-built for adventure, these jackets and pants are perfect for exploring the city, or setting your sights on distant mountain peaks. Elasticated Waistband: Wide, elasticated waistband keeps these pants super comfortable. Zipped Hems: Wide, zipped hems let you pull these pants on over your boots. Dope DRYTECH Membrane: Dope DRYTECH membrane offers superior waterproofing and breathability through the use of hydrophilic membrane technology. Actively drawing moisture from the skin, the membrane keeps you dry even during intense sessions. 15.000 mm / 15.000 g – DRY Tech. Durable Water Repellent (DWR): All of our fabrics are treated using a PFAS-free, eco friendly DWR treatment from HeiQ EcoDry. Water beads off instead of soaking in, improving waterproofing, and keep the fabric working at maximum breathability.. Fully Taped Seams: We fully tape our seams to make sure water can't get in. The seams are the weakest point of any garment, so by using a special tape that makes them totally waterproof, you can ride in the deepest powder or the gnarliest storms with confidence.. 3-Layer Stretch Fabric: Our 3-layer 4-way stretch super lightweight shell has a smooth, eco-friendly high-performance DWR treated outer, along with a highly waterproof inner membrane. Laminated together with a smooth tricot backer for ultimate comfort, it offers totally mobility without bulk for unbeatable versatility, no matter the situation. bluesign® approved materials..",

It’s got a super stretchy and cosy poly-spandex construction with a smooth outer that actively wicks moisture away from the skin, and a soft and plush brushed inner that’s comfy on the skin all day long. We also added some special Dope touches to put it right over the top, too.\n\nThe fit is perfect — not too tight, not too baggy. Just right for all day riding. And with the spandex content, it’ll fit all body types and shapes without pulling or adding unnecessary pressure, meaning you can ride in complete comfort. On top of that, we added in a rolled turtleneck for ultimate temperature regulation, which completes the Snuggle as the best dang base layer in the whole wide, snow-covered world. Or at least we think so.",

      "description": "Snuggle up this winter with the Snuggle base layer bottoms. They fit like leggings, perform like baselayers, and feel amazing. We gave them a super technical polyester-spandex mix construction, which is ultra stretchy, highly breathable, and moisture-wicking so you stay cool and comfortable. And speaking of comfort…We gave them a smooth outer so that they feel great under your outer layers, and a brushed inner so they’re all fleecy and cosy! Up top there’s also a wide elasticated waistband to relieve pressure and keep them in place, meaning you can focus on your riding, instead of yanking your pants up every ten seconds.Add in flatlock seams to prevent chafing, and a tight-but-not-too-tight figure-hugging fit, and these are without doubt the best base layers in the universe (unless some advanced alien race have developed some better ones — but that can’t be helped, I guess).",

It’s got a super stretchy and cosy poly-spandex construction with a smooth outer that actively wicks moisture away from the skin, and a soft and plush brushed inner that’s comfy on the skin all day long. We also added some special Dope touches to put it right over the top, too.\n\nThe fit is perfect — not too tight, not too baggy. Just right for all day riding. And with the spandex content, it’ll fit all body types and shapes without pulling or adding unnecessary pressure, meaning you can ride in complete comfort. On top of that, we added in a rolled turtleneck for ultimate temperature regulation, which completes the Snuggle as the best dang base layer in the whole wide, snow-covered world. Or at least we think so.",

Now equipped with an improved peached backer for unbeatable comfort, along with reinforced flatlock seams to eliminate chafing and provide unmatched durability, the Snuggle base layers are a result of years of refinement.

It’s got a super stretchy and cosy poly-spandex construction with a smooth outer that actively wicks moisture away from the skin, and a soft and plush brushed inner that’s comfy on the skin all day long. We also added some special Dope touches to put it right over the top, too.\n\nThe fit is perfect — not too tight, not too baggy. Just right for all day riding. And with the spandex content, it’ll fit all body types and shapes without pulling or adding unnecessary pressure, meaning you can ride in complete comfort. On top of that, we added in a rolled turtleneck for ultimate temperature regulation, which completes the Snuggle as the best dang base layer in the whole wide, snow-covered world. Or at least we think so.",

      "description": "The new generation Snuggle base layers are the perfect companion for all your winter adventures. Made with a super stretchy and highly breathable recycled polyester-spandex blend with Anti-Odour HeiQ tech and our quickest drying and most moisture-wicking construction yet, the Snuggle is ready for even the most active days on the mountain.

Now equipped with an improved peached backer for unbeatable comfort, along with reinforced flatlock seams to eliminate chafing and provide unmatched durability, the Snuggle base layers are a result of years of refinement. The result is the most comfortable and functional base layers available: ride every day, all season in total comfort. bluesign®: bluesign® is a rigorous certification that ensures our clothing is sustainably produced, reducing water waste and harmful chemicals.

      "description": "The Snuggle is just about as snuggly as base layers come. It’s got a super stretchy and cosy poly-spandex construction with a smooth outer that actively wicks moisture away from the skin, and a soft and plush brushed inner that’s comfy on the skin all day long. We also added some special Dope touches to put it right over the top, too.\n\nThe fit is perfect — not too tight, not too baggy. Just right for all day riding. And with the spandex content, it’ll fit all body types and shapes without pulling or adding unnecessary pressure, meaning you can ride in complete comfort. On top of that, we added in a rolled turtleneck for ultimate temperature regulation, which completes the Snuggle as the best dang base layer in the whole wide, snow-covered world. Or at least we think so.",

      "description": "Dope Spartan Jacket sports a super clean and straightforward design, featuring a contrast waterproof front zipper and two zipped side pockets for all your essentials. With its all-in retro \"box\" shape and adjustable bottom drawstring, the Spartan is all about combining throwback style with modern performance. Designed with 2-way stretch, this jacket ensures maximum mobility, letting you move freely whether you're carving through powder or throwing down in the park. The Spartan is perfect for those who appreciate a minimalist aesthetic but still demand a jacket that can do it all. Built around a lightweight and bombproof shell fabric platform with built in 2-way stretch, the Freedom collection is designed for maximum mobility. A minimalist approach keeps you light on your feet so you can truly push your riding. bluesign®: bluesign® is a rigorous certification that ensures our clothing is sustainably produced, reducing water waste and harmful chemicals. This means safer working conditions for workers and a cleaner environment for all. This is a bluesign® approved product, adhering to the highest standard in the bluesign® certification. Recycled: Our Recycled Polyester PET is sourced from repurposed plastic bottles. It significantly reduces pollution, lowers greenhouse gas emissions, and conserves energy and water compared to virgin polyester. Recycled materials on this product: All Shell Fabric, All Insulation and All Lining Storm Guard Hood: Helmet-compatible storm guard hood with front and rear drawstring adjustment for the perfect fit. Underarm Vents: Large zipped vents are perfect for quick cooling. Media Pocket: Secure internal pocket designed for your phone and other valuables. Lift Pass Pocket: A velcro pocket for your ski pass perfectly located on the left sleeve for easy access. Wrist Gaiters: Stretchy and comfortable, perfect for keeping the snow out. Front Zipper with Inner Placket: Waterproof front zipper and wide inner placket ensures waterproofing in tough conditions. Microfleece Chinguard: Super soft microfleece lined chinguard Drawstring Hem: Adjustable drawstring hem lets you customise your fit and style. Waterproofing: Snow and rain are part of a rider's reality. That's why we use a bonded waterproof membrane that provides a solid barrier against moisture, together with a PFAS-free DWR treatment for rapid water beading and runoff. 15.000 mm – DRY Tech. Breathability: Managing the humidity that builds up inside from body heat is crucial. Our bonded membrane system offers top-notch breathability, effectively managing moisture. 15.000 g – DRY Tech. Taped Seams: The seams are the weakest point of any garment, so by applying a special adhesive tape that makes sure water can't get in, you can ride in the worst conditions with confidence. Fully taped – TSGS. Climate Control: Thermal Insulation with state-of-the-art materials, combining perfect comfort with high thermal insulation properties, for true all-day comfort. 60/40 gsm – Fellex®.",

      "description": "We’re not saying that the Stanton neckwarmers are the best neckwarmers you can buy ... But if you wanted to say that, then we wouldn’t argue! Made from sturdy 100% recycled polyester softshell fabric, this neckwarmer boasts a 15k waterproof rating, as well as 15k in breathability. And on top of that, we added our eco-friendly PFAS-free DWR coating to help you shrug off powder shots to the face. We then made it totally ergonomic and shaped to the face so that it reduces pressure on the bridge of the nose, making breathing easier. And with air-holes perfectly positioned, you can breathe as hard as you want and never feel constricted. All this is finished off with a super cosy terry-loop inner, so you can ride all day in total comfort. If you’re looking for a facemask you can put on in the morning and not take off until the last lift, you just found it. bluesign®: bluesign® is a rigorous certification that ensures our clothing is sustainably produced, reducing water waste and harmful chemicals. This means safer working conditions for workers and a cleaner environment for all. bluesign® approved materials on this product are: All Fabric Recycled: Our Recycled Polyester PET is sourced from repurposed plastic bottles. It significantly reduces pollution, lowers greenhouse gas emissions, and conserves energy and water compared to virgin polyester. Recycled materials on this product: All Fabric",

      "description": "Skinny, stretchy snow pants. You might be sold already, just from those four words. But if not, allow us to sweeten the deal. We threw in a little spandex to give these pants some elasticity, and then cranked things up with some awesome design touches. They’ve got waterproofing for days, a 2-way stretch, as well as a snug fit with a bootcut hem, you know, just for a splash of retro flair. There are few pairs of pants out there that look like this, and even fewer that can handle everything mother earth serves up. From the jungle to the slopes, the tiger is on the hunt! Utilising our highest performance materials and design, this collection provides maximum environmental protection, and features designed to ride the biggest lines and the deepest powder. This collection can do it all, no matter the conditions. Elasticated Snow Gaiters: Non-slip cuff with lace hook for secure snow protection. Zippered Gusseted Hems: Gusseted hems provide enhanced boot fit, tailored snow protection, and a customisable look. Elastic Adjustable Waistband: Elasticated velcro tabs for quick and secure adjustment. For the perfect fit! Reinforced Fly Closure: Dual snap button and velcro closure for secure and comfortable fit. Waterproofing: Snow and rain are part of a rider's reality. That's why we use a bonded waterproof membrane that provides a solid barrier against moisture, together with a PFAS-free DWR treatment for rapid water beading and runoff. 15.000 mm – DRY Tech. Breathability: Managing the humidity that builds up inside from body heat is crucial. Our bonded membrane system offers top-notch breathability, effectively managing moisture. 15.000 g – DRY Tech. Taped Seams: The seams are the weakest point of any garment, so by applying a special adhesive tape that makes sure water can't get in, you can ride in the worst conditions with confidence. Fully taped – Sealon.",
